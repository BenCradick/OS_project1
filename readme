### How to run
        $ cd your/directory
        $ make
        $ ./cradick.1

You will need an input file at a minimum formatted like so.
Firt line is the number of of rows to be reversed. 1/2 - 1 rows in file.
Even number rows: number of elements in the following row.
Odd numbered rows (excluding first): Numbers to be reversed.


### Known Issues
Improperly formatted input will not be properly hanled. Rows that are too short may cuase the stack to fill up when it shouldn't.
Rows that are too long will fill up the stack and force an errror.

The code is not pretty.

###Encountered problems 
Getting the stack to function properly was headache. I ended up using function pointers in a structure to make it work.
I couldn't figure out how to have the stack structure initialize itself like a constructor would in an OOP.
I need to somehow move the createStack function inside the rest of the stack structure so that you don't have to pass a reference pointer to all of the functions.
Also it would be great if the  stack could hold a reference to itself for when it needs to operate on itself.

I was fairly confused as to why gcc wasn't importing the proper header files on hoare. I eventually realized to make the CFLAGS in my make file --std=gnu99 instead of --std=C99.
